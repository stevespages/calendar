*Calendar* Class
==============

Demonstration
-------------

This shows the result of transforming the PHP array output from the *Calendar* Class. It is envisaged that the data structure (an array) generated by the Calendar class will be used in conjunction with other code (for example which might add events) and displayed by other code which could be PHP or JavaScript using Ajax to get the data structure, modified or not, from a server.
